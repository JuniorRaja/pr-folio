# 5. Google Search Console + Sitemap Submission

Date: December 28, 2025

What I did:
- Went to https://search.google.com/search-console
- Added property: URL prefix → https://yourdomain.com (also added www version if separate)
- Verified ownership: DNS TXT record method (added TXT in Cloudflare DNS)
- Submitted sitemap:
  - Location: https://yourdomain.com/sitemap.xml (auto-generated by Vercel/Next.js or Vite plugin)
- Requested indexing for main pages (Home, About, Projects etc.)

Result:
- Site officially known to Google
- Faster crawling/indexing expected (hours to days)
- Can later check impressions, clicks, coverage
